Network Sharing Module
======================

Handles sharing discoveries to the network and retrieving network knowledge.

Core methods:
- share_control_discovery_to_network: Share "I am this object" discoveries
- learn_from_movement_correlation: Learn object control from action-movement
- get_network_control_hypotheses: Retrieve validated hypotheses from network
- validate_control_hypothesis: Update hypothesis reliability after use
- synthesize_composite_hypothesis: Tier 6 synthesis of multiple hypotheses

This module implements the "thought process colony" for self-model knowledge:
- Tier 1: Observation (discoveries made during gameplay)
- Tier 2: Sharing (this module - broadcast to network)
- Tier 3: Validation (other agents validate)
- Tier 4: Usage (agents use hypotheses)
- Tier 5: Selection (hypotheses compete by outcome)
- Tier 6: Synthesis (combine hypotheses into composites)
