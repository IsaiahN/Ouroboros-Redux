# PORT LOG — the egocentric port onto v4-cold

Beat log for a human who was away. Every entry leads with the L2 count against the cold
baseline. Charter: `EGOCENTRIC_PORT_PLAN.md` (§6 fusion, §7 the wheel rule).

---

## ENTRY 1 - 2026-08-10 - THE BASELINE IS FINAL: 20 generations, 1800 episodes, 6 games at L1, ZERO L2. Phase 1 opens.

> ## **L2 count: 0 (baseline 0 — nothing to beat yet; Phase 3 owns that number).**

**The baseline hardened all the way.** Run 2 (gens 10–19) added ZERO new L1 games — the same six
(`ar25 cd82 ft09 lp85 m0r0 r11l`), 85 banked sequences total, max level_completions still 1 in
all 1800 episodes. The lottery's cheap tickets are spent: breadth stalled at 6/25 and depth never
started. DB 425 MB / 20 gens, knowledge pipeline healthy throughout, telemetry-dominated.

**Phase 1 (the self) opens this beat:** verbatim port of `perception` + `self_locus` + `agency`
from `Nexus:src/newhorse/` into `engines/egocentric/`, wrapped by a small `EgoObserver`, wired
READ-ONLY into the loop (logs `[EGO]` lines, feeds nothing). Prereg: `PREREG_PHASE1.md`.
Pre-wire control shas capturing now (4 games, seed 5) → `.runs/p1_controls.json`.

---

## ENTRY 2 - 2026-08-10 - PHASE 1 LANDS READ-ONLY (containment 4/4 byte-identical). Capability OPEN at 2 named / 1 vacuous / 1 under diagnosis - and the vacuous case exposed a stock-v4 crash.

> ## **L2 count: 0 (baseline 0). Phase 1 committed at `493f96c`; Phase 2 CLOSED until capability clears.**

**The build:** verbatim ports (sha1-verified byte-identical to `Nexus:src/newhorse/`) of
`perception` / `self_locus` / `agency` + the `EgoObserver` wrapper; ONE 13-line read-only block
in `record_result`; gate 10/10 re-derived; tests were shown failing first (9F/1P).

**Containment PASSED perfectly:** all four pre-wire shas reproduced exactly - the observer is
provably inert on behaviour.

**Capability NOT yet passed (prereg: fix-or-revert before Phase 2):** `ka59` and `dc22` name a
stable controllable colour; `su15` errors/flaps (diagnosis pending - background assumption or
None frames); `ls20` is VACUOUS - and that vacuity is the beat's discovery:

> ### **STOCK v4'S COGNITIVE LOOP CRASHES ON SOME GAMES AND SILENTLY FALLS BACK TO THE OLD STACK.** `[PTMA-ERR] CognitiveLoop failed: cannot access local variable 'random'` - a shadowed-variable bug. It fired 109 times across the 20-generation baseline (45+64 in the run logs), so a slice of the 1800 baseline episodes never ran the cognitive path at all. `ls20` hits it every episode in hermetic runs. Pre-existing, not Phase-1 damage; the fallback is silent at default log level - the silent-failure class, again, in the loop itself.

**Next:** capability extension on 4 more movement-capable games (seed 6, running); su15
diagnosis; the `[OPEN]` question for Isaiah - whether to fix the stock `random`-shadow bug on
v4-cold (it changes stock behaviour, which the baseline was measured on) or leave it and score
capability only on non-vacuous games.

---

## ENTRY 3 - 2026-08-10 - PHASE 1 COMPLETE: capability CLEARS at 4 non-vacuous games. The crash census grows to 3 of 25.

> ## **L2 count: 0 (baseline 0). Phase 1 fully passed; PHASE 2 (the goal spine) MAY OPEN.**

**Capability, final:** `ka59` `dc22` `cd82` `m0r0` all name a stable controllable colour by the
final third under pure action-contingency - the >=4 threshold is met. `su15` remains the one
genuine non-namer (error-flapping; diagnosis queued, non-blocking). `ls20` `tu93` `tr87` are
vacuous: **all three crash stock v4's cognitive loop every hermetic episode** (the PTMA
`random`-shadow bug) and play on the fallback stack. The [OPEN] question for Isaiah stands and
now matters more: Phase 2 cannot reach those three games until the one-line bug is fixed (as its
own pre-registered, gated change) or they are excluded from the port's scope.

**Phase 1 verdict: both falsifiers resolved.** Containment 4/4 byte-identical; capability 4
named of 5 non-vacuous. The loop now has eyes for its own body on every game where the loop
itself survives.

---

## ENTRY 4 - 2026-08-10 - PHASE 2 v1 PASSES BOTH FALSIFIERS: the wheel exists, it is closed by default, and it steers when signal opens it.

> ## **L2 count: 0 (baseline 0). Phases 1-2 complete; PHASE 3 (ledger + mint, then the L2 attack) is next.**

**Containment 4/4:** every control sha byte-identical - without a confirmed reward the whole
egocentric stack is provably inert (the wheel rule as a measured property, not a promise).

**Consumption 3/4 (threshold >=2):** with the instrument-side forced confirm, `dc22` drove 23
actions toward the market's winner, `m0r0` 15, `cd82` 3; `ka59` accepted the credit and refused
to drive - no established action strictly helped, and the unhelpful-map rule held. The refusal
is as load-bearing as the drives.

**What exists now on v4-cold:** stock v4 (untouched behaviour, byte-verified twice) + an
egocentric layer that knows WHICH body is its own (contingency, not correlation), learns WHICH
action moves it WHERE (live, answer-free), proposes candidate goals from appearance
(cue-proposes), and will steer toward one ONLY once a real level-up confirms it
(reward-disposes). Next: Phase 3a - the falsified ledger + mint (hypotheses die by prediction
error; knowledge compounds only under the MDL guard), then 3b promote/seed, then the L2 attack
scored against the baseline of zero.

---

## ENTRY 5 - 2026-08-10 - PHASE 3a PASSES ALL THREE FALSIFIERS: the fabric is live, the mint is gated, and the pariah loop closed from real play.

> ## **L2 count: 0 (baseline 0). Phases 1-3a complete. Next: 3b (population-scale promote/seed), then 3c - the L2 attack.**

**What the falsifiers measured (re-derived from raw logs and session fabrics):**

| | result |
|---|---|
| containment: empty fabric, 4 control shas | **byte-identical 4/4** - memory does nothing without signal |
| consumption: pre-seeded corroborated ideas | **2/4 diverged** (dc22 drove 12 actions, cd82 3) - threshold met exactly |
| the pariah loop closes from live play | **2 falsifications written back** (ka59, m0r0 reached seeded cells rewardless) |

The refusals matter as much as the drives: ka59 loaded its seed, had no established action that
helped, and refused the wheel (Phase-2 rule holding through Phase 3). The economy now runs
end-to-end in real episodes: seed -> pursue-or-refuse -> confirm(echo)/refute(falsify) ->
write back -> the next agent inherits a corrected market.

**The stack, in Isaiah's terms:** allocentric evolution (stock v4, untouched) underneath;
egocentric self + goal + memory above it; ideas now have authors, prices, reputations and
graveyards. What is NOT yet real: population-scale circulation (3b) and any L2 (3c's number).

---

## ENTRY 6 - 2026-08-10 - 3b'S FALSIFIER FIRED, MECHANISM READ: the credit wire requires a self-centroid, and click games never have one. A real level-up was dropped. The click-side economy is the fix.

> ## **L2 count: 0 (baseline 0). 3b verdict: circulation BROKEN at the mint - not in the fabric, in the credit gate.**

The trial (12 agents, 3 gens, 5346 actions): the observer ran everywhere (514 [EGO] lines), a
REAL level-up occurred on the cognitive path (click-only game, action 84) - and zero CONFIRM,
zero MINT, no fabric dir (lazy: nothing ever appended). The credit branch is gated on the
controllable's centroid; on click games the contingency test can never name a controllable
(nothing moves WITH the choice), so the centroid is None forever and rewards are discarded.
Movement-side economy: proven live in 3a. Click-side: does not exist. Most banked L1s are click
games. Fix prereg'd: PREREG_PHASE3B2.md - credit at the ACTED-ON cell (the clicked cell when
the rewarded action was a click), CLICK_AT ideas, click-drive under the identical wheel rule.

Also measured from source this beat (PREREG_PHASE3C.md): replay episodes RETURN at replay
completion - the remaining budget is discarded; stock v4's only reliable route to L2's doorstep
ends the episode on arrival. The 3c handoff fixes that after 3b2 lands.
