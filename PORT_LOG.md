# PORT LOG — the egocentric port onto v4-cold

Beat log for a human who was away. Every entry leads with the L2 count against the cold
baseline. Charter: `EGOCENTRIC_PORT_PLAN.md` (§6 fusion, §7 the wheel rule).

---

## ENTRY 1 - 2026-08-10 - THE BASELINE IS FINAL: 20 generations, 1800 episodes, 6 games at L1, ZERO L2. Phase 1 opens.

> ## **L2 count: 0 (baseline 0 — nothing to beat yet; Phase 3 owns that number).**

**The baseline hardened all the way.** Run 2 (gens 10–19) added ZERO new L1 games — the same six
(`ar25 cd82 ft09 lp85 m0r0 r11l`), 85 banked sequences total, max level_completions still 1 in
all 1800 episodes. The lottery's cheap tickets are spent: breadth stalled at 6/25 and depth never
started. DB 425 MB / 20 gens, knowledge pipeline healthy throughout, telemetry-dominated.

**Phase 1 (the self) opens this beat:** verbatim port of `perception` + `self_locus` + `agency`
from `Nexus:src/newhorse/` into `engines/egocentric/`, wrapped by a small `EgoObserver`, wired
READ-ONLY into the loop (logs `[EGO]` lines, feeds nothing). Prereg: `PREREG_PHASE1.md`.
Pre-wire control shas capturing now (4 games, seed 5) → `.runs/p1_controls.json`.

## ENTRY 2 - 2026-08-10 - PHASE 1 LANDS READ-ONLY (containment 4/4 byte-identical). Capability OPEN at 2 named / 1 vacuous / 1 under diagnosis - and the vacuous case exposed a stock-v4 crash.

> ## **L2 count: 0 (baseline 0). Phase 1 committed at `493f96c`; Phase 2 CLOSED until capability clears.**

**The build:** verbatim ports (sha1-verified byte-identical to `Nexus:src/newhorse/`) of
`perception` / `self_locus` / `agency` + the `EgoObserver` wrapper; ONE 13-line read-only block
in `record_result`; gate 10/10 re-derived; tests were shown failing first (9F/1P).

**Containment PASSED perfectly:** all four pre-wire shas reproduced exactly - the observer is
provably inert on behaviour.

**Capability NOT yet passed (prereg: fix-or-revert before Phase 2):** `ka59` and `dc22` name a
stable controllable colour; `su15` errors/flaps (diagnosis pending - background assumption or
None frames); `ls20` is VACUOUS - and that vacuity is the beat's discovery:

> ### **STOCK v4'S COGNITIVE LOOP CRASHES ON SOME GAMES AND SILENTLY FALLS BACK TO THE OLD STACK.** `[PTMA-ERR] CognitiveLoop failed: cannot access local variable 'random'` - a shadowed-variable bug. It fired 109 times across the 20-generation baseline (45+64 in the run logs), so a slice of the 1800 baseline episodes never ran the cognitive path at all. `ls20` hits it every episode in hermetic runs. Pre-existing, not Phase-1 damage; the fallback is silent at default log level - the silent-failure class, again, in the loop itself.

**Next:** capability extension on 4 more movement-capable games (seed 6, running); su15
diagnosis; the `[OPEN]` question for Isaiah - whether to fix the stock `random`-shadow bug on
v4-cold (it changes stock behaviour, which the baseline was measured on) or leave it and score
capability only on non-vacuous games.
