Game Scheduler - Prevents redundant game plays and distributes agents efficiently.

Core Rules:
1. No two agents can play the same game_id simultaneously
2. Game types are distributed round-robin across agents
3. Agent modes are distributed evenly per game type
4. Games with winning sequences get lower priority (or optimizer-only)
