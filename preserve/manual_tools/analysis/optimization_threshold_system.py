Optimization Threshold System
=============================

Tracks optimization progress per game-level and determines when a level is
"sufficiently optimized" (diminishing returns). Once optimized, optimizers
should use the best sequence and move on to unoptimized levels.

Philosophy:
- Track optimization improvement rate per generation
- If improvement < X% for N generations → level is "optimized"
- Optimizers use best sequence for optimized levels (no more attempts)
- Focus optimizer effort on high-value targets (unoptimized/unbeaten)

Rule 2: All data in database
Rule 4: LLM Self-Management - adaptive thresholds
