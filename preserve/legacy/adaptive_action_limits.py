Adaptive Action Limit Manager
=============================

Automatically adjusts max_actions_per_level and max_total_actions based on
generation performance. Gives more exploration time to successful agents/generations,
and reduces time for unproductive ones.

Rule 4: LLM Self-Management - System adjusts autonomously based on data

FIX #20: ACTION BUDGET DETERMINATION RULES
==========================================
Action budgets are determined ONLY by:
1. Agent PERFORMANCE (level completions, efficiency)
2. Agent ROLE (Pioneer gets more, Exploiter gets less)
3. Generation metrics (network-wide adjustments)

Action budgets are NEVER determined by:
- Prestige score (social capital - completely separate)
- Discovery count (affects prestige, not budgets)
- Network contribution (affects prestige, not budgets)

This is a SACRED separation per Master Ruleset.
