Execution Trace Miner - Primitive Sequence Pattern Discovery
=============================================================

Extracted from cods_engine.py - discovers frequent primitive composition
patterns by mining agent execution logs.

Similar to market basket analysis - finds patterns like:
"When agents succeed, they often do: detect_object -> get_position -> calculate_distance"

This is the MISSING LINK in the composition system - it generates composition
suggestions based on what actually works in practice.
