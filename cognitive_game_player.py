"""
Cognitive Game Player — GamePlayer adapter that uses CognitiveLoop.

This module wraps the existing GamePlayer with the Perceive-Think-Map-Act
cognitive loop. It can be used as a DROP-IN REPLACEMENT for GamePlayer
or alongside it (controlled by a flag).

The key insight: we DON'T rewrite the 1,400-line game_player.py.
Instead, we wrap its decision path with the cognitive loop while
preserving all existing functionality (replay, mastery, events, etc.).

Usage in evolution_runner.py:
    from cognitive_game_player import CognitiveGamePlayer
    player = CognitiveGamePlayer(game_player)
    result = player.play_game(agent, game_id, generation, is_running_fn)
