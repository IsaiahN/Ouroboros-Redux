SAFE DATABASE CLEANUP
=====================
The primary database cleanup routine for the Ouroboros system.
Called by autonomous_evolution_runner.py and can be run standalone.

DATA LIFECYCLE PHILOSOPHY:
==========================
Data in this system follows a lifecycle:

1. RAW OBSERVATIONS (Per-Game Ephemeral)
   - object_property_snapshots, trigger_sequence_events, collision_events
   - Only useful DURING gameplay to detect patterns
   - Once patterns extracted to aggregated tables, raw data is redundant
   - CLEANUP: After game ends AND patterns recorded

2. AGGREGATED KNOWLEDGE (Permanent Network Memory)
   - interaction_triggers, trigger_sequences, collision_effects
   - Compressed patterns validated across multiple agents/generations
   - Like winning_sequences - these ARE the learned knowledge
   - CLEANUP: NEVER delete (only deprecate if stale)

3. VALIDATION-DEPENDENT DATA (Cross-Generational)
   - Triggers have occurrence_count, consistent_count, inconsistent_count
   - Each new agent validates/refutes patterns, refining confidence
   - Raw data from current generation needed for validation
   - CLEANUP: Keep current generation's raw data until validation complete

RETENTION STRATEGY:
==================
- Raw data: Keep from last 30 GENERATIONS (not time-based!)
- Aggregated patterns: Keep forever (mark is_active=FALSE if stale)
- Stale pattern threshold: 50 generations with no observations
- ASYNC-SAFE: Uses generations as computational clock, not wall time
- PORTABLE: Works on any hardware speed - fast machine = more gens/day

WHAT THIS CLEANS:
- Zero-score game results (failed games, no learning value)
- Old system/database logs (keep recent 5,000)
- Old score history (>7 days)
- Old sensation learning events (keep 200,000)
- Excessive navigation state history (keep 50,000)
- Old action traces (keep 500,000)
- Old player state history (keep 100,000 - dominates DB by volume)
- Raw observation data from COMPLETED generations
- Stale patterns (50+ generations without observation)

WHAT THIS PRESERVES:
- Winning sequences (CRITICAL)
- Active agents
- Game results with positive scores
- All aggregated knowledge patterns (interaction_triggers, trigger_sequences, etc.)
- Current generation's raw observation data (for cross-agent validation)

Per Master Ruleset Rule 2: All data in database, intelligent cleanup

Usage:
    python safe_cleanup.py              # Dry run (shows what would be deleted)
    python safe_cleanup.py --execute    # Actually perform cleanup

Called from autonomous_evolution_runner.py every 10 generations.

class SafeDatabaseCleaner:
    """
    Safe database cleanup that preserves all critical learning data.

    DATA CATEGORIES:
    ================

    1. EPHEMERAL RAW DATA (delete after N generations complete):
       - object_property_snapshots: Object state per action (huge volume)
       - object_property_changes: Property change log
       - trigger_sequence_events: Individual trigger steps during gameplay
       - collision_events: Individual collision records
       - action6_availability_events: ACTION6 state changes

       These are PER-GAME observations. They're linked to game_id, which
       has a generation number. We keep raw data from the last N generations
       (default: 10) to ensure cross-agent validation can complete.

       SAFE: Uses multi-layer protection:
       1. Try generation-based via game_results.generation
       2. Try generation-based via session -> agent link
       3. Final fallback: keep most recent 50M records by count

       ALL methods are generation-agnostic (no time assumptions).
       System paused for a month? Nothing deleted until new gens run.

       RETENTION: Keep raw data from last 30 generations

    2. AGGREGATED KNOWLEDGE (never delete, only deprecate):
       - interaction_triggers: Causal patterns with consistency scores
       - trigger_sequences: Proven trigger orderings (winning sequences)
       - collision_effects: What happens when objects collide
       - selectability_conditions: What enables ACTION6
       - autonomous_objects: NPCs/independent movers

       These ARE the learned knowledge. Like winning_sequences, they
       represent compressed wisdom from thousands of observations.

       RETENTION: Permanent. Mark is_active=FALSE if stale (50+ generations
       without observation or confidence < 10% after 20+ attempts).

    3. OPERATIONAL DATA (standard retention by count/age):
       - score_history: 7 days
       - system_logs: 5,000 entries
       - navigation_state_history: 50,000 entries
       - action_traces: 500,000 entries

        Clean raw observation data tables using PURE GENERATION-BASED retention.

        NO TIME-BASED LOGIC. The system measures its own computational progress
        (generations), not human wall-clock time. This makes it:
        - Asynchronous (no 24/7 requirement)
        - Portable (works on any hardware speed)
        - Self-referential (system measures itself)
        - Safe during pauses (nothing deleted until new generations run)

        Strategy:
        1. Get current generation from agents table (MAX(generation))
        2. Calculate cutoff = current_gen - retention_generations
        3. Delete raw data linked to games from generations < cutoff
        4. If generation link not available, fall back to COUNT-based (keep N most recent)

        The count-based fallback is also generation-agnostic - it just keeps
        the most recent N records regardless of when they were created.

        disk rulings 2026-08: score-keyed deletion removed; ground evidence
        protected. The pre-ruling version kept the top 20 rows per
        (game_type, level_number) ranked by a reward proxy and hard-DELETED
        the rest -- D-1, the condemned key still in production, latent only
        because the table's writer was never wired (F8A_READ.md). Ranking by
        reward is the exact criterion that ate the metrics corpus twice

             (same columns plus an archived_at stamp). The archive table is
             append-only and is never itself a cleanup target (archive law).

             equal the live row count, in the same transaction.
          3. TRUNCATE the live table with NO predicate -- no row is ever
             SELECTED for removal, so nothing can be selected by a proxy.
        A failed or short copy aborts LOUDLY and leaves the live table
        untouched. Rows removed from the live table are reported as
        'archived', not 'deleted': the archive is the record.
